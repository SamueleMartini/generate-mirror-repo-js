# Additional Packages

## Purpose

The packages in this directory are not available through packagist.org (they are only available through repo.magento.com).

Because these third party bundled extensions are not included in Magento releases since 2.4.4, they are included in
this repository so older releases can be provided through the mirror package repository.

## Background

The extensions are hosted in public GitHub repos. At one point in time Magento added them as a dependency.
At that time the original git repositories where forked by Magento/Adobe into non-public repositories.  
Magento core did not upgrade the dependencies with upstream, but instead provide their own patched versions.
